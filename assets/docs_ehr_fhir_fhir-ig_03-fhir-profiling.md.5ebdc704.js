Profiles are important to limit the flexibility [of FHIR] for a few given use cases. In a project, you will make profiles to ensure that you define the resources and the constraints on these resources specific to the use case. - <code>Ewout Kramer, FHIR co-creator and CTO of Firely</code>.</p><h2 id="get-started-with-profiling" tabindex="-1">Get started with profiling <a class="header-anchor" href="#get-started-with-profiling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Get started with profiling&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="the-terms-profile-and-profiling" tabindex="-1">The terms &quot;profile&quot; and &quot;profiling&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-terms-profile-and-profiling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The terms &quot;profile&quot; and &quot;profiling&quot;&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>A <code>profile</code> is a set of constraints on a FHIR resource or data type, or another FHIR profile. The term is however also colloquially used to refer to an implementation guide or a conformance package.</p></li><li><p>The term <code>profiling</code> refers to the act of applying constraints to FHIR structures, and authoring other FHIR Conformance resources to define the set of specific conformance rules for your context. Applying constraints leads to the creation of a FHIR Profile.</p></li><li><p>Constraints can also be applied to existing profiles. These &quot;profiles on profiles&quot; are called <code>derived profiles</code>. These profiles are made by further constraining profiles that have been made by yourself of by someone else, the so-called base profile.</p></li></ul><h3 id="canonical-url" tabindex="-1">Canonical URL <a class="header-anchor" href="#canonical-url" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Canonical URL&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Every FHIR conformance resource you create will need to have a canonical URL. This is a globally unique identification for that resource.</p><p>There are three nice things that a canonical URL allows the author to communicate:</p><ul><li><p>It is common practice to use the website domain of the organization that maintains the FHIR conformance resource, to indicate who is responsible for it. For example, the canonical URLs for conformance resources from HL7 all start with: <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/</code>.</p></li><li><p>It makes it easier to avoid conflicts with other authors, since they will never create a canonical URL that starts with the same base.</p></li><li><p>Using a URL, it is possible to set up a documentation site, where that canonical resolves to if you would enter it in your browser.</p></li></ul><p>Not all canonical URLs resolve directly to an actual wesite, and are therefore only used for identifying a conformance resource. The <a href="https://simplifier.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Simplifier.net</a> platform can resolve the canonical URLs of all resources from the projects uploaded there. Click <a href="https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.us.core/6.1.0/files/2080253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UsCore.Patient</a> to see canonical URL example.</p><p><strong>Note: Before you start to create profiles, tghink about a naming convention and document that as part of a list of &#39;profiling guidelines&#39;.</strong></p><h3 id="cardinality-constraints" tabindex="-1">Cardinality constraints <a class="header-anchor" href="#cardinality-constraints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cardinality constraints&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When you start creating a profile, the most common need is to change the cardinality of a field. Any field in the FHIR structure can be restricted. For example, when a field is optional in the base structure, you can make it mandatory by setting the minimum cardinality to 1. The maximum cardinality can be changed as well, to limit a list of elements to just 1 or any other number that is your maximum.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cardinality min</th><th>Cardinality max</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>element is forbidden</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>element is optional, and can only occur once</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>*</td><td>element is optional, and can repeat</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>element is mandatory, and can only occur once</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>*</td><td>element is mandatory, and can repeat</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It is not possible to make mandatory fields optional, or change singular fields into a list. All data still needs to conform to the core FHIR specification, so you cannot make your model more lenient.</p><p><strong>Note that when you set the maximum cardinality to 0, you actually forbid that element to be in the data. Author with care, because this can be very restrictive!</strong></p><h3 id="fixing-values" tabindex="-1">Fixing values <a class="header-anchor" href="#fixing-values" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fixing values&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Another common constraint is to fix a value for a field. You can use fixed values to specify a value that SHALL be exactly the value presented in the data. For example, in the profile for the blood pressure Observation, you could fix the value of the code field to the LOINC code that represents a blood pressure measurement. When fixing a value for a complex data type, such as CodeableConcept, we recommend to fix it on the lowest possible place in the hierarchy of that complex structure. This allows for more flexbility in the data values for the other fields of that structure.</p><h3 id="exercise-1-create-first-profile" tabindex="-1">Exercise 1: Create first profile <a class="header-anchor" href="#exercise-1-create-first-profile" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exercise 1: Create first profile&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Alpha Hospital wants to receive FHIR patient data from general practitioners. First, only administrative data of patients and their general practitioner are included. After some meetings the following requirements are specified.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A patient has at least 1 family and 1 given name</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth is mandatory</td></tr><tr><td>Only home addresses can be used</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>In Forge, select <code>New...</code> in the project window.

Togiether with other conformance resources, example resource instances and documentation, they make it clear how FHIR is used for your case or context. One of the reasons the StructureDefinition was added to the FHIR specification, is that you can easily share it with others to show what you expect from the data.</p><p>Once you have shard your profiles, others will be able to find the structures you have published and will be able to use them. Since they are in a computable format, they can be used for things like validating data or generating user interfaces.</p><h3 id="publication-platform" tabindex="-1">Publication platform <a class="header-anchor" href="#publication-platform" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publication platform&quot;">​</a></h3><p>WHile it would be nice if a conformance resource can be retrieved by simply entering its canonical URL into a browser, not all organizations can or want to setup and maintain a server that can responds to such requests. For that reason, the <a href="https://simplifier.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Simplifier.net</a> platform was created. On the Simplifier.net registry, you can create a project and publish your conformance resources, so others will be able to find them.</p><p>When you have used the Forge tool to author your profiles, it will be very easy to publish your work thanks to the integration of Forge with Simplifiler. But also when your StructureDefinitions are created by other means, for example with <code>FHIR Shorthand (FSH)</code> and <code>Sushi</code>, it is possible to upload them to your Simplifier project with just a couple of clicks.</p><h3 id="example-data" tabindex="-1">Example data <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example data&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the things that will help others to use your profile correctly, is having a set of example resource instances. For each profile you create, try and create one or two good examples of resources that conform to your profile.</p><p>Fill the resources with (synthetic) data to show what you would expect. Focus on the fields on which you have made changes, but also do not forget other fields that you would usually expect in the data, even if you did not have extra requirements for those.</p><p>Use the <code>profile</code> field in the resource&#39;s metadata to indicate it conforms to your profile. To do this, add the canonical URL of your profile as value in the <code>profile</code> field.</p><h3 id="exercise-2-upload-local-profiles-to-simplifier" tabindex="-1">Exercise 2: Upload local profiles to Simplifier <a class="header-anchor" href="#exercise-2-upload-local-profiles-to-simplifier" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exercise 2: Upload local profiles to Simplifier&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="synchronize-your-work" tabindex="-1">Synchronize your work <a class="header-anchor" href="#synchronize-your-work" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Synchronize your work&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In this step, we will synchronize our local changes to the Simplifier project that was linked previously.</p><p>If you have closed Forge between the exercises, please:</p><ul><li>Open Forge</li><li>Open your project folder</li></ul><p>When you have your project open in Forge:</p><ul><li>Make sure all your work is saved.</li><li>Open the <code>Simplifier</code> menu, and choose <code>Sychronize</code>.</li></ul><p>Pay attention to any messages in the dialog that is shown. The <code>Sychronize...</code> option will upload changes you made locally, but also download resourses from the Simplifier project if they were changed there. This could lead to potential conflicts, for example when you have made chanegs to the same profile on Simplifier as well as locally.</p><ul><li>When you are happy with the choices in the dialog, choose <code>Continue</code>.</li><li>Once the sychronization is complete, you can go to your project on <a href="https://simplifier.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Simplifier.net</a> and look at your profiles there.</li></ul><h4 id="create-example-data" tabindex="-1">Create example data <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-example-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create example data&quot;">​</a></h4><p>An Important part of your project is to provide examples of the data you expect, so in this step we will create an example resource instance that comforms to the profile.</p><p>If you already have a (synthetic) set of FHIR resources, for example generated by <a href="https://synthea.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Synthea</a>, you can use those as your base. Another option is to go the FHIR specification and to download example resources - make sure to select the FHIR version you are working with.</p><p>The first steps have you select one of the standard Patient examples. Skip these if you have a different base for your example:</p><ul><li>Go to <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FHIR R4 Patient example</a> to see the list of example Patient resources.</li><li>Select one of the resources from the list, and download it in your preferred format (XML or JSON).</li><li>Add the downloaded resource to the folder that contains your profile.</li></ul><p>We will have to edit the resource using an editor. Forge only focuses on conformance resources and does not have an option for editing resource instance data.</p><ul><li>Open the downloaded resource in an editor, if possible one that understands XML and/or JSON structures.</li><li>If they are not present, add a &quot;meta&quot; field and &quot;profile&quot; subfield to your resource.</li><li>Set the canonical URL of your profile as the value for the <code>profile</code> field.</li><li>Save the resource.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, we can use <a href="https://simplifier.net/yamlgen?scope=hl7.fhir.r4.core@4.0.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Simplifier yamlgen playground</a> to create examples.

This will help make it clear what you expect the data to look like when it is exchanged in the context of your use case. However, the user of your profiles might also need to know more. For example, they may be interested in the reason behind yopur requirements, how the profiles interact, and what kind of exchanges need to be supported.</p><p>Implementation Guides - or IGs - are the way to supply the user with this kind of documentation.
